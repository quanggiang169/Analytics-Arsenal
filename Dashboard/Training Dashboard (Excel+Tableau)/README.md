# Training Dashboard Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the process of cleaning and preparing data using Excel and visualizing the cleaned data in a dynamic dashboard using Tableau. The dashboard focuses on analyzing training-related metrics to provide insights into training performance and effectiveness.

## Objectives
- **Track the company’s training activities over the course of a year** by creating a comprehensive dashboard that monitors training organization, schedules, and progress towards completion.
- **Analyze learner data** using key metrics such as training hours, completion rates, and demographic factors (e.g., department, age, job title), which helps in understanding how different groups are engaging with training programs.
- **Evaluate cost allocation** by assessing how the training budget is distributed across various programs and comparing it against key metrics to determine whether the investment aligns with training outcomes and organizational goals.
- **Address inefficiencies in resource allocation** by providing insights into where resources (both time and budget) are being underutilized or overinvested, helping improve future training strategies and cost-effectiveness.

- ### Data Cleaning
- **Handling Missing Data**: Fill in or remove missing values to ensure data consistency.
- **Removing Duplicates**: Identify and eliminate duplicate records to maintain clean and accurate data.
- **Data Transformation**: Standardize column names and formats, ensuring the data is consistent and suitable for analysis.

### Key Tracking Features
- **Training Program Completion Tracking**: Track the number of training programs completed on schedule. This feature helps monitor whether training programs are being completed within the planned timeframes.
- **Participant Tracking**: Track the number of participants in each training program, comparing actual attendance with the planned attendance. This helps identify discrepancies and monitor participation levels.
- **On-Time vs. Delayed Completion**: Identify which training programs were completed on time and which were delayed, providing insight into the efficiency and scheduling of training activities.

### Learner Analysis
- **Demographic Segmentation**: Analyze training participation and performance based on employee demographics such as department, job role, and age. This helps identify trends and areas where training may need to be tailored for different groups.
- **Completion and Engagement**: Track how engaged learners are by monitoring participation rates and completion of assigned training modules.

### Cost Allocation Evaluation
- **Budget vs. Actual Cost Comparison**: Track and compare actual training expenditures against the planned training budget. This comparison helps evaluate if the training costs align with the goals and outcomes.
- **Resource Allocation Efficiency**: Identify areas where training resources may be underutilized or over-invested, offering insights to improve future training budget planning.

### Interactive Dashboard
- **Filters**: Users can filter data by department, training type, or date range to focus on specific insights.
- **Drill-Down Features**: Enable users to click on specific metrics to explore deeper details, such as viewing data for a particular department or specific time period.

### Annual Training Overview
- **Training Execution**: Track the percentage of planned training hours utilized, on-time course delivery, and completion rates.
- **Learner Participation**: Assess average training hours per learner, discrepancies between planned vs. actual learners, and compliance with mandatory training requirements.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Monitor cost overruns, cost per learner, and cost per training hour to evaluate budget control and cost-effectiveness.

## Tools Used
- **Excel**:
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing.
  - Transformations and basic analytics.
- **Tableau**:
  - Dashboard creation and visualization.
  - Publishing dashboard on Tableau Public.
 
## Workflow
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Gather raw training data from internal sources.
2. **Requirement Document Creation**:
   - Define the objectives, scope, and key metrics of the dashboard.
   - Specify data sources, target audience, and any specific needs or constraints.
   - Ensure alignment with business goals and stakeholder expectations.
3. **Data Cleaning (Excel)**:
   - Remove duplicates and irrelevant columns.
   - Handle missing data (e.g., filling, dropping).
   - Standardize column names and data formats.
4. **Data Analysis (Excel)**:
   - Calculate key metrics such as total hours, completion rates, and averages.
5. **Dashboard Creation (Tableau)**:
   - Import cleaned data into Tableau.
   - Create visualizations like bar charts, line charts, and heatmaps.
   - Design an interactive and user-friendly dashboard layout.
6. **Publishing**:
   - Publish the dashboard to Tableau Public for sharing and review.
  
## Dataset Description
- **Source**: Simulated training dataset with fictional employee training data, provided in an Excel file containing three sheets:
  - **List of Courses**: Contains details about each training course.
  - **List of Learners**: Includes information about trainees, such as employee ID, department, and demographic details.
  - **Training Progress**: Tracks training activities.
